PhD Project (University of Saarland, Germany)

Scope. Micro-air vehicles (MAVs), also known as drones, are semi-autonomous systems increasingly employed in environmental monitoring, surveillance, and rescue operations. The exploration of new techniques related to MAVs design has recently leaned towards biomimicry, the engineering branch that draws inspiration from nature to discover new effective solutions. This project falls precisely within this context, addressing the limitations of conventional motors and gears by utilizing innovative actuation techniques. Specifically, the research was carried out on Shape Memory Alloys as actuators for the flapping movement of the wings, as they can, in the form of micro-wires, closely resemble artificial muscles: they require no gears, can be activated by electrical current pulses, and exhibit a higher power output with a smaller footprint than state-of-the-art actuators.  
  
This project focuses on the design, manufacturing, and testing of a compact, lightweight, and functional final prototype capable of generating aerodynamic thrust, and ready for a range of potential future additional features and applications.
